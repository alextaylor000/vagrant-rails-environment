This is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) environment for Rails development. It should work across Windows, Mac and Linux! :tada:

_NOTE:_ The Vagrantfile/Cheffiles were generated by [rove.io](http://rove.io/). Check it out for more details.

## Requirements
* A computer
* Ruby (see [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) for an easy way to install Ruby on Windows)
* A few gems (see Step 3 below) which are required to get the virtual machine up and running

## Step 1
Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Step 2
Download zip file containing `Vagrantfile` and `Cheffile`

Put it into a directory on your computer.

## Step 3
In your command line, navigate to the folder containing your `Vagrantfile` and `Cheffile.`

Within that folder, run the following commands:

```
gem install chef 

gem install 

gem install librarian-chef 

librarian-chef install
```

## Step 4
Run `vagrant up` from the project directory.

Vagrant will download a disk image containing the base virtual machine, and apply all the configuration settings from the `Vagrantfile` and `Cheffile` to that image. Then, it should boot the virtual machine.

If you're unable to connect in the subsequent steps, run `vagrant up` again from this folder.

## Step 5 - Windows
Install PuTTY (follow the relevant parts of [these instructions](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/))

## Step 6 - Windows
Use PuTTY to connect to your Vagrant box:

Host: localhost

Port: 2222

Username: vagrant

Password: vagrant


## Running a Sinatra server
Add [this bind command](https://gist.github.com/jhabdas/5945768) to your sinatra `app.rb` file so that you can run it through your Vagrant machine but access it through your normal browser.


## Troubleshooting
### I can't use Letter Opener!
See the [letter opener docs](https://github.com/fgrehm/letter_opener_web#usage) for how to use letter opener with Vagrant.
